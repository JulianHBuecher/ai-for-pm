## Course Assignments

As part of each class, one assignment follows at the end. This repository serves as central point for the solutions of the class assignments.

### Class Assignment 1 - Machine Learning Fundamentals

The first class assignment is based on the problem described in this [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261030021_Prediction_of_full_load_electrical_power_output_of_a_base_load_operated_combined_cycle_power_plant_using_machine_learning_methods). The task involved to create a model to predict the power outcome of a power plant utilizing different machineries to create electrical power.

The solution is written as a Jupyter Notebook which could be found [here](assignment_one/CCPP_Analysis.ipynb).
